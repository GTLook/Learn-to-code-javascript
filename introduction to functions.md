#Functions

Functions are just a bit of code that you can write and run later.  They start out by naming them then bracketing the code you want to run in a bracket `{}`.  Try running this code and guessing what it does!

```shell
const cat = " =^.^= "

const drawCats = function (howManyTimes) { 
	for (let i = 0; i < howManyTimes; i++) { 
		console.log(i + cat) 
	} 
}


//you can call(run) the function like this!
drawCats(10)
```

Go ahead and try it out in a repl.it.  Try playing parts of the code and see what you can do!
