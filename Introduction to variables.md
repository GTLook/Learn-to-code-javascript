# Variables are as easy as naming! 

today we'll teach both 'let' and 'const'

'let' allows you to name variable names that you want to change in the future.

```shell
let myAge = 28
```

'const' refers to the name of a varable that you dont want to change.

```shell
const myCat = " =^.^= "
```

try it out!
